Particle detection algorithm
============================
Matlab routines of an automatic particle detection algorithm, initially
designed and used to study the time-resolved resuspension of isolated micro
particle mono-layers exposed to airflow acceleration.
Contains folders: one used to create synthetic images in order to test the
algorithm and another used for experimental data (images of particle deposition
obtained using cameras) processing.


Language
========
Coded using Matlab, with use of the image processing toolbox.


Usage
=====
Each folder contains a self-described 'XXX_main.m' file, where XXX is either
'experimental' or 'synthetic'.
